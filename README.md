Connect your laptop and MG400 via EathaNet Cable.

### 2.6 Set Fixed IPv4 Adress on Mac
Go to Network settings on your macbook. Set your EathaNet network IPv4 adress on "192.168.1.40". (Sorry, I'm using macbook with Japanese.) Subnet mask should be "255.255.255.0".

## 3. Install CRI
### 3.1 Clone CRI Repository
```
$ git clone https://github.com/nlepora/cri
```
### 3.2 Set System Variable "PYTHONUTF8=1"
Set environment variable "PYTHONUTF8" to "1" on Windows Settings. The default language to read setup file is "cp932" in Windows, and it will cause encode error. This environment variable sets it UTF8.
