# How to use CRI on macbook Pro M1 with Pararell Desktop
CRI is an common interface to control various robot arms published by Nathan Lepora in University of Bristol. In this repository, I explain how to control Dobot MG400 with CRI on macbook, while Dobot Studio Pro is availbale only on Windows.

# Environment
- M1 MacBook Pro 2020 (macOS Monterey 12.3.1)

### 2.5 Connect EathaNet Cable
Connect your laptop and MG400 via EathaNet Cable.

### 2.6 Set Fixed IPv4 Adress on Mac
Go to Network settings on your macbook. Set your EathaNet network IPv4 adress on "192.168.1.40". (Sorry, I'm using macbook with Japanese.) Subnet mask should be "255.255.255.0".

### 2.7 Launch Dobot Studio Pro and Connect to MG400
You will find your MG400 with IP adress "192.168.1.6". If you cannot find it, try to reboot Dubot Studio Pro.

### 2.9 Install Git

## 3. Install CRI
### 3.1 Clone CRI Repository
```
$ git clone https://github.com/nlepora/cri
```
### 3.2 Set System Variable "PYTHONUTF8=1"
Set environment variable "PYTHONUTF8" to "1" on Windows Settings. The default language to read setup file is "cp932" in Windows, and it will cause encode error. This environment variable sets it UTF8.

### 3.3 Install C++ Build Tool with Desktop Environment
We need C++ Build Tool to install Pybullet. Install it with "desktop envirionment". Don't forget to check desktop environment on installing process.

### 3.4 Install CRI
I'm not perfectly understand how these installation working, but these are what I executed.
```
$ python setup.py install
$ pip install -e .
$ pip install pybullet
$ pip install opencv-python
$ pip install numpy
$ pip install pyqt5
```

### 3.5 Install TactileGym
https://github.com/ac-93/tactile_gym

```
$ cd ../
$ cd tactile_gym_2
$ git clone https://github.com/yijionglin/tactile_gym_2
$ cd tactile_gym
$ python setup.py install
$ cd  ../cri
```

## 4. Run Test
Then, the robot is ready to run!
```
$ python examples\mg400_robot_test.py
```


# How to control Digital Output via CRI
CRI Client looks not supporting Digital Output Control. You can control it by the code below, should be in "examples\mg400_robot_test.py"
```
# Test Robot Movement
robot.move_linear((0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0))

# Test Digital Output
robot.controller._client._dashboard.DO(9,1)
time.sleep(1)
robot.controller._client._dashboard.DO(9,0)
time.sleep(1)
robot.controller._client._dashboard.DO(10,1)
time.sleep(1)
robot.controller._client._dashboard.DO(10,0)
```
